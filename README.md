# Home Office Engineering and Architecture 

This guide explains the fundamental principles for Engineering and Architecture at the Home Office.

## Core principles
All services must follow our [core principles](/principles.md)

## GDS service standard and code of practice
All services must meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and follow the [GDS Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice).

## Security
Services must be designed with security in mind, as described in our [security guide for developers](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/security-guide-for-developers/wiki)

## Testing
[Automated Testing](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/testing-guide-for-developers) is integral to modern software development.

## APIs
Our [API best practice guide](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/api-guide-for-developers) describes how to develop interoperable web services.

## Hosting Platform
Our [hosting platform](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/hosting-platform) is built upon Docker and Kubernetes.
The [Technical Service Requirements](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/technical-service-requirements) should be followed for every service that is developed.
The [platform developer guide](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/hosting-platform/blob/master/developer-docs/README.md) describes how developers can leverage its components.
