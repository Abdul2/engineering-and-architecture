# Home Office Engineering and Architecture guide 

This guide explains the principles for Engineering and Architecture at the Home Office.

# Engineering
Every service that is developed must adhere to the [Technical Service Requirements](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/technical-service-requirements).

Security by design is everybody's responsibility - see our [security guide](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/security-guide-for-developers/wiki).

Testing is integral to software development - see our [testing guide for developers](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/testing-guide-for-developers).

Interoperability using open web standards is [Government Policy](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/working-with-open-standards) - see our [API best practice guide](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/api-guide-for-developers)

All services must also:
Meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and follow the [GDS Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice)
