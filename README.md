# Home Office Engineering and Architecture guide 

This guide explains some core principles for Engineering and Architecture at the Home Office.

# Engineering

All services must meet the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and follow the [GDS Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice)

The [Technical Service Requirements](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/technical-service-requirements) should be followed for every service that is developed.

[Security by design](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/security-guide-for-developers/wiki) is everybody's responsibility.

[Automated Testing](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/testing-guide-for-developers) is integral to modern software development.

Our [API best practice guide](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/api-guide-for-developers) describes how to develop interoperable web services.
