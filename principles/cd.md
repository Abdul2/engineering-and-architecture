### <a name="cd"></a>10 Continuous Delivery by default

Releasing more often in [smaller batch sizes](http://www.alwaysagileconsulting.com/articles/tag/batch-size/) can reduce defect probablity and cost as well as increase stability.

[Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html) is a way of developing and building software that favours the Continuous flow of changes (bug fixes, configuration changes, new features) into Production over larger changes that are orchestrated by traditional Change Management processes and remove traditional post "dev complete" phases such as Integration testing, and the dreaded "Code Freeze".

You know when you're doing Continuous Delivery when:

- Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
- Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
- Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
- You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand


There are additional [Technical Service Requirements](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/technical-service-requirements/blob/master/docs/cd.md) for Continuous Delivery when using the DSP Platform and tools.
